In my 13 months of working at my current job, I've noticed a few things. 

First, I cannot communicate clearly with my coworkers. They use the "proper" technical ways of describing things with their computer science degrees, and I use my hacky I'm-still-new-at-this way of describing things and it's like I was dropped off in a country with a foreign language and I'm one of those people with a thick accent that everyone just kind of tolerates. 

Second, problem-solving is an uphill battle for me. What will take me a day will take a fellow coworker a few minutes of focused reasoning. At this point I have touched enough of our codebase to be able to figure things out. I don't need to ask questions since I can figure stuff out for myself, but the figuring takes an extremely long time. 

Finally, even front end developers these days are expected to understand basic computer science. It has been the source of a lot of anxiety for me. I’ll start a coding challenge, see the first question, scramble around on Google for an answer, realize everything out there is written in jargon I don't understand, give up, and close the browser window in defeat and fear. I just am not there yet.

My conclusion is that _there is a gap_. While I know web development tools, I am sorely missing a foundation of theory and logic that is crippling my progress. As my boyfriend said, “You know how to build an Angular app but you don’t know how to build Angular.” 

Some of my bootcamp classmates have been proactive about filling the gap. They voluntarily read about [sorts](http://csunplugged.org/sorting-algorithms/) and [big-O notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/) and can actually hold a conversation about these topics. While I enjoy coding, it is not my life. I have many hobbies and interests and I like to devote equal time to each.

**But coding is a jealous mistress.**

Even though I gave her 3 solid months of my life (and continue to give her 9 hours of my day), it is not enough. There is still so much I do not know and I see the effects of this gap daily.

Something has to give.

I did some googling and found that I can cobble together my own computer science curriculum from online lectures and books and other people’s experiences. I’m not entirely sure what I’m doing, but I’m no longer aimless. And some knowledge is better than the desert that is currently my mind. So while I very much wanted to enjoy this summer and be carefree on the weekends, I’d rather buckle down and be able to look back a year from now and say thank God I took the time to learn that stuff. Wish me luck!
